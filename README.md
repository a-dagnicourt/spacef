spacef / a fucking SpaceX launches infos app
======

## Project goal

* Get your lazy ass informed on SpaceX launches
* Get my lazy ass a kick to learn Vue 3

## How it works

* read the fucking package.json

What to expect
------

```
Now :
```
* A broken screensaver-like app that shows you infos on the next launch
* No responsive, fuck mobile-first dev.
* Basic infos you can find on every shitty website that use SpaceX as clickbait
* An artistic try at making maps looking cool (*spoiler : it failed*)

```
One day, maybe :
```
* Full infos on every fucking launchs and events
* Fully responsive app so you can check it on your 2k$ iPhone
* Integrated youtube lives. When available.
* Astro/cosmo/spacio/taiko-nauts profiles. Only for Crew Dragon, ok Sherlock ?
* A lots more.
* Or not.
* We'll see.
